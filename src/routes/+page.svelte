<h1>Introduction To Typography</h1>

<h3>What is Type?</h3>
<p>
	Well let's start by sorting out two terms that get confused a lot, font and typeface. This might
	seem like a nit picky distinction, but it's a distinction that actually reflects the dual nature
	of type.
</p>
<p>
	On the one hand, type is a tangible thing, a movable kit of pre-designed forms that can be
	shuffled around to make words. And on the other hand, it's something less tangible, a work of
	design that can be represented and re-represented at many sizes and in many formats.
</p>




<p>
	A font originally referred to one set of metal type.In a California job case, a standard filing
	system for metal typet hat has the letters and other typographic elements arranged according to
	frequency of use, not unlike the way that the keys are arranged on a computer keyboard. Metal type
	obviously can't be made bigger or smaller or italic or bold. So a font of metal type is just one
	type design in one style, in one weight at one size. Movable type like this was first invented in
	China around 1040 by an inventor named Bi Sheng. It was reinvented 400 years later in Germany in
	the 15th century by Johannes Gutenberg. Gutenberg carved his letter forms at actual scale and then
	cast them in a mixture of metals, mostly lead.

	The process of letterpress printing remained the main technology for setting and reproducing type
	from its invention in the 1450's up into the 1960's. And even today, a lot of the vocabulary we
	use to talk about type references letterpress technology. In the 1960s and 70s, metal typesetting
	was replaced by photo typesetting. A photo type font,was essentially a slide or film reel of
	letter forms that was projected in sequence onto photo paper. Today, a font of type is a .otf or
	.ttf file stored on your computer. These files contain vector information describing the shapes of
	the letter forms, and also information about the space between different combinations of letters.
	So a font is the physical manifestation of type, whether in metal, film or code.

	In contrast to a font, typeface describes the visual design of a particular set of letter forms.
	Typefaces are massive design projects. To create a fully functioning contemporary typeface, a
	designer must create hundreds and thousands of carefully considered individual drawings.
</p>
<p>
	At minimum, typefaces these days include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers called
	figures, often in several different styles,fractions and mathematical symbols, punctuation and
	special characters, accented characters in both upper and lower case. And ligatures, specially
	drawn combinations of two or more letters. All of these characters must be individually drawn in
	both regular and italic styles. And both of these styles must be drawn in at least three weights.
	Different degrees of boldness. So type faces are time consuming and skill demanding works of
	design. And like other works of design, they're protected as intellectual property. In order to
	use a type face in the piece of design work, you need to have a license to do so. The typefaces
	that come with our operating system or other software have been licensed for us by the software
	company. But most other high quality typefaces must be purchased and downloaded from their
	designer or distributor in order to be used legally.
</p>

<h3>Stroke and Proportion</h3>
<p>
	What really define the character , the look and feel of a typeface on actually use is not it's
	details but some overall qualities of stroke & proportion , and these qualities are what
	typographers pays most attention to when they're are looking at types. The forms of the
	typographic alphabet emerged from scribes' handwriting in the 15th century. So the lines that form
	letters are called strokes and are based on calligraphic marks.

	Weight is the thickness of a stroke, and this varies between typefaces and also within type
	families. Stroke weight contributes to the type's color, how dark or light it appears when set in
	text. Stroke modulation is how much the thickness of the stroke changes in different parts of the
	letter.
</p>


<p>
	In traditional calligraphy, the brusher pen is held at a constant angle as the letters are drawn,
	creating a stroke with a lot of modulation. The modulation of a stroke implies a tilt or axis to
	the letterform. In more calligraphic typefaces, this axis is usually angled and in more mechanical
	typefaces it tends to be vertical.
</p>
<p>
	In humanistic typefaces, strokes often end with a little wedge-shaped form called a seraph The
	presence or absence of serifs divide all typefaces into the categories of serif and sans serif.
	Sans from the French, meaning without. And these two styles have quite different textures on the
	page. Some designers argue that serifs make type easier to read by creating an imaginary line that
	the type sits on, and that guides our eyes along each line of text. And for this reason, serif
	type faces are conventionally seen as more appropriate for long bodies of text.
</p>
<p>
	Besides qualities of stroke, the overall appearance of a typeface is also determined by its
	proportions. Some typefaces have narrow and tall condensed letter forms, while others have squat
	and wide extended forms. That small scale condensed type on the left looks blocky and dense,
	extended type looks kind of airy.
</p>
<p>
	Another important proportion is what might roughly be described as the size relationship between
	lowercase and uppercase letters. And this is called the x-height of the typeface. The x-height is
	the imaginary line that defines the height of many of the lowercase letters. Typefaces with a
	large x-height with a proportionally larger lowercase letters, like this typeface, look bigger and
	more even on the page. Typefaces with a small x-height with proportionally smaller lowercase
	letters look smaller and more delicate.
</p>
<p>
	Taken all together, these over all qualities of proportion and of stroke are what really give a
	typeface it's particular appearance at type size.
