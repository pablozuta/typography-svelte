    <h3 class="under">Stroke and Proportion </h3>
<p>
	What really define the character , the look and feel of a typeface on actually use is not it's
	details but some overall qualities of stroke & proportion , and these qualities are what
	typographers pays most attention to when they're are looking at types. The forms of the
	typographic alphabet emerged from scribes' handwriting in the 15th century. So the lines that form
	letters are called strokes and are based on calligraphic marks.

	Weight is the thickness of a stroke, and this varies between typefaces and also within type
	families. Stroke weight contributes to the type's color, how dark or light it appears when set in
	text. Stroke modulation is how much the thickness of the stroke changes in different parts of the
	letter.

<p>
	In traditional calligraphy, the brusher pen is held at a constant angle as the letters are drawn,
	creating a stroke with a lot of modulation. The modulation of a stroke implies a tilt or axis to
	the letterform. In more calligraphic typefaces, this axis is usually angled and in more mechanical
	typefaces it tends to be vertical.
</p>
<p>
	In humanistic typefaces, strokes often end with a little wedge-shaped form called a seraph The
	presence or absence of serifs divide all typefaces into the categories of serif and sans serif.
	Sans from the French, meaning without. And these two styles have quite different textures on the
	page. Some designers argue that serifs make type easier to read by creating an imaginary line that
	the type sits on, and that guides our eyes along each line of text. And for this reason, serif
	type faces are conventionally seen as more appropriate for long bodies of text.
</p>
<p>
	Besides qualities of stroke, the overall appearance of a typeface is also determined by its
	proportions. Some typefaces have narrow and tall condensed letter forms, while others have squat
	and wide extended forms. That small scale condensed type on the left looks blocky and dense,
	extended type looks kind of airy.
</p>
<p>
	Another important proportion is what might roughly be described as the size relationship between
	lowercase and uppercase letters. And this is called the x-height of the typeface. The x-height is
	the imaginary line that defines the height of many of the lowercase letters. Typefaces with a
	large x-height with a proportionally larger lowercase letters, like this typeface, look bigger and
	more even on the page. Typefaces with a small x-height with proportionally smaller lowercase
	letters look smaller and more delicate.
</p>
<p>
	Taken all together, these over all qualities of proportion and of stroke are what really give a
	typeface it's particular appearance at type size.
