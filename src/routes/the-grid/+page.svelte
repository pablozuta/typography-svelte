	<h3 class="under">The Grid</h3>
	<p>
		One way you can make a typographic composition look refined is to define a structure for the
		space of page or screen and then to align elements in the composition to this structure. And in
		typography, this structure is called a grid.
	</p>
	<p>
		People have been using grids of one kind or another since the earliest days of printing and
		before.
	</p>
	<p />
	<p>
		In traditional Chinese manuscripts for instance, text is arranged in columns of equal width, and
		each character takes up a perfectly square space, within it's column.
	</p>
	<p>
		In Medieval Europe, the pages of books were sometimes laid out with margins that were defined by
		the golden ratio, a special mathematical proportion. Scribes and later typesetters often used
		systems of lines to measure out these margins. They noticed that this system creates margins
		that are of different widths at the top, bottom, left, and right of the page. And this creates a
		composition with a dynamic rather than a static feel. The proportion of the golden ratio,
		roughly 1.618 Continued to inform typographic composition in the 20th century.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jan Tschichold, the German typographer who advocated for sans serif type in the 1920's, studied
		medieval manuscripts and often applied the golden ratio to his compositions. In this poster from
		1938 for instance, Tschichold arranged elements in relationship to a structure based on that
		ratio.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the mid twentieth century designers of the Neue Grafik movement in Switzerland refined the
		use of grids to create highly organized visual structures.
	</p>
	<p>
		Defining and using a grid can help you create compositions that feel visually refined. Grids are
		particularly useful in publications where they can help each spread feel like it belongs to the
		next.
	</p>
	<p>So let's look at the elements of a classic page grid.</p>
	<p>
		Margins define the borders of the main printed area of the page. If you're setting up margins
		for a book, it's important to remember that the inside margin corresponds to the spine, so
		depending on how the publication will be bound, it's a good idea to make that margin pretty
		generous.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some layouts use a hang line. The point on the page where for instance text, and new chapters
		might begin. Large format publications often use multiple columns so that line length can be
		kept reasonable.
	</p>
	<p>
		Often those columns are in turn subdivided so that the designer has the flexibility to create
		text blocks of different widths. Some spanning several columns.
	</p>
	<p>
		The space between columns is called the gutter and often the width of the gutter is set to the
		size of the type's leading.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, a baseline grid can be used to make sure that lines of text and adjacent columns are on
		succeeding pages lined up with one another. There. And the interval of these lines will be
		defined by the leading of the type.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, grids are almost everywhere that typography is. On the web, they're often actually built
		into the CSS. A popular website grid like the one used on this sight on grid systems is 960
		pixels wide, with 6, 12, or 16 columns across.
	</p>
	<p>
		Grids are a really useful tool. Still, if they're used incorrectly or just too much, they can
		limit and constrain your compositions. So I'd recommend always starting compositions without a
		grid. And then once you figured out what you want to do, go back and reverse-engineer a grid
		that will help you refine alignments and make distances consistent. And always remember that
		there are plenty of instances where a grid may not be necessary or even appropriate at all.

Together, the spaces are a guide to Van Hagen’s tastes that clients can explore in person. “A lot of my clients visit me at home,” says Van Hagen. “I never sell any of the works here, but I tend to support the artists that I also collect.”</p>

Many of my clients become friends. Whether they are in their 80s, 50s or 20s, I have a very personal relationship with all of them. It is easier that way; they know what I’m made of, and conversations are easier.</p>
