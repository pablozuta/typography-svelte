<h3>Type Anatomy</h3>

<p>
	Although the details of individual letter forms are usually invisible at small scale, it's still
	important to look at letters up close. And to be able to identify and describe their features. The
	two fundamental visual elements of a letter form are the stroke, the black part of the letter, and
	the counter, the white part.
</p>
<p>
	Because the counter is often bigger than the stroke some typographers argue that when we read type
	at small scale we actually are recognizing the counters of the type rather then the strokes. Roman
	letter's have been around for a long time so there's a lot of esoteric terminology for describing
	their different parts.
</p>
<p>
	The main vertical part of the stroke is called the stem. The end of a stroke is called the
	terminal. This rounded kind of terminal is a lacrimal and this kind is a spur. The rounded counter
	is found in some letters are called the bowls. Many of the parts of letters are named after parts
	of the human body. This is a leg. A shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	This part of a g is an ear. The inside counter of a e is an eye. And the center part of an s or
	other curved letter is a spine.

</p>
<p>
	The x-height, which we've already discussed, defines the height of the main body of lowercase
	letters. Any part of a lowercase letter form that extends above the x-height is called an
	ascender. The baseline is the line on which the letters sit. Any part of a letter form that
	extends below the baseline is called a descender. In many typefaces, uppercase letters are
	actually slightly shorter than ascenders. So their height is defined by a cap-height metric.
</p>

<p>
	As you can see, curved parts of letters actually extend a little bit above and below the x-height
	and base line. And this is because from a distance our eyes see circles as smaller than squares.
	So curved elements are made larger to compensate. There is much more terminology for describing
	letter forms. But this will give you enough of the vocabulary to begin to describe, and to
	understand the different features of typefaces.
