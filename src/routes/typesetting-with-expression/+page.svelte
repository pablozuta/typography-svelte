	<p>
		 In traditional typography, the objective has
		usually been to present the text in as elegant, legible, and efficient a way as possible.
		Typographic styles have historically reflected the conventions of the time period more than they
		have the content of the text.
	</p>
	<p>
		But since the start of the 20th century, artists and designers have experimented with ways of
		using typography expressively.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1916 for instance, the French surrealist poet <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Guillaume-Apollinaire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Guillaume Apollinaire</a>  published this concrete poem. The poem is about
		rain and its typographic form expresses this as much as its content does.</p>

		<p>
		This book from around
		the same time by the Italian futurist Felipo Marinetti sets out to capture a visceral sense of
		war through dramatic typographic compositions.</p>

		<p>
		 And in this book, a mid century typographic
		interpretation of a play by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eugene-Ionesco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Eugene Ionesco</a> , typographic compositions express the tone and pace
		of the dialogue progressing from subdued to frenetic.

			class="artist__img"
			alt="blue poster typographic"

			<p>We can create a composition that suggests horizontal movement, like in this poster about canal
				boats, conjuring up the slow movement of the boats along the water.</p>

		<div class="card">

				class="artist__img"
				alt="skycraper typographic design"

			<p>
				Or a composition that feels
			   vertical, like in this poster for a conference in Shanghai, a city know for its skyscrapers.

				class="artist__img"
				alt="vortex poster typographic"

			<p>Here in this poster from the 1920s the vortex gesture
				expresses the dizzy feeling of being in the bustle of a modern city.</p>

				alt="flies and letters typographic design"

			<p>
				And this composition that is
			  random and scattered, perhaps suggesting chaos or something organic, like these flies.
		  </p>
		</div>

	<p>
		Or in the opposite extreme, we can create a gridded and orderly composition like Armin Hofmann,
		the mid century Swiss designer, has done in this poster about formal principles. 
		</p>

		<p>
		There's no
		formula here for exactly what compositional gesture or what typographic style will best express
		a particular meaning. But that doesn't mean that designers are off the hook. Typography is
		always about communication and a piece of expressive type is only successful if it is able to
		clearly convey its intended message to an audience.
